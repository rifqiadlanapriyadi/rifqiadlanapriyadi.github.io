								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am currently a Master's student at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, doing research in Programming Languages and Software Development Environments. Throughout my career, I've completed numerous projects from different Computer Science fields. They range from generating algorithms and making dashboards, to developing video games, creating an automatic cocktail mixer, and making my very own compiler. Currently, my research interest is in "Customizable Visual Debuggers".</p>
								<p>To list out, I've become familiar with Java, Python, C#, C++, C, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Haskell. I have been using these languages over the course of my studies and projects and will definitely utilize, and consequently learn other languages. In my spare time, I often develop video games for fun, mostly using Unity.</p>
								<p>Aside from being proficient in my own studies, I am also a good communicator. On top of being a skilled public speaker, I've had a lot of success in not only explaining subjects to juniors as a teaching assistant and to fellow classmates, and I consider myself a detailed and attentive listener, allowing me to be a quick study.</p>

								<!-- <p>I am currently in my second semester of a two-year Master's program at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, majoring in Mathematical and Computing Science. I have wanted to go to, study, work and live in Japan since I was little. Other than its unique and interesting culture and food, I have always heard of how orderly and polite the people are. Not to mention that Japan grows very rapidly in the field of technology, which certainly includes Computer Science.</p>
								<p>My major encourages and facilitates the exploration of real-world problems in the realm of computer science and the proposal of a solution with the assistance of mathematical theories. My research field is in Programming Languages and Software Development Environments. It is the field that discusses the improvement of the programming experience, both in the workings of programming languages and in the tools and environments programmers use to write in these languages. My research interest here is currently on "Visual Debuggers with a Customizable View".</p> -->

								<!-- <p>I received my Bachelor's degree at the University of Twente, the Netherlands, majoring in Technical Computer Science, with a Cum Laude distinction. I chose to do my Bachelor's overseas to be able to experience the culture and different philosophies of people from all over the world, and the Netherlands is the best choice for this. Not only is the Netherlands praised for its multiculturalism, but it is also the nation with the most proficient English speakers in the world outside of the Anglosphere.</p>
								<p>In this major, I was able to understand a wide variety of concepts relating to Computer Science. The program is module-oriented, in that different courses that relate to each other are already bundled up for a period of ten weeks. Each course and module provides the theoretical knowledge of its subjects, and an equal, if not, more amount of time for practical work based on the established theories. After introducing the different Compter Science subfields, each module thereafter delves deeper into each subfield, allowing for a more structured understanding.</p>

								<h3 class="major">JIGSAW: Visual Debugger with a Customizable View</h3>
								<h4>September 2021 - Present</h4>
								<p>A debugger is a computer program used by programmers to test and help find mistakes (bugs) in the program they are currently writing. It allows programmers to see the state of the program in a step-by-step manner. However, once programs are large enough, the states become difficult to understand, especially since most debuggers do not provide any graphical visualizations to help the programmers in this effort. Moreover, another problem arises when programmers would like to customize these visualizations to better understand the states according to their conventions.</p>
								<p>This research aims to propose a solution to these two problems. It aims to investigate and execute the approaches for the development of a debugger with intuitive, convenient, and easy-to-understand visualizations. On top of that — and by far the most challenging part — it also aims to make this visualization customizable according to the programmer's liking.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Projects/JIGSAW.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I chose this topic because similar projects have not seemed to have accomplished this view customizabiliy feature. Additionally, I am also motivated by my personal experience with debuggers in this area. Finally, since this is new territory for me, I would learn lots of new technologies and concepts in this research, including the workings of programming languages, the development of a programming tool, and the makings of intuitive user interfaces in the debugger's front-end.</p>

								<p>MODEST is a modeling language built and designed by the Formal Methods and Tools Group of the University of Twente together with the Dependable Systems and Software Group of Saarland University. Its purpose is to facilitate programmers with simulations — hereafter referred to as models — of systems that they can specify. A model specification written in this language is then translated into automata that, in turn, simulate the model.</p>
								<p>The problem this research proposed a solution for is the absence of iterative specification statements, which is a result of its nature of translating a specification into automata instead of into another language as with most languages. This research devised a way to work around this shortcoming by adding a new syntax into the language and processing it in a way that imitates iterative declarations. This research was presented at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/utwente.nl/tscit35/">35<sup>th</sup> Twente Student Conference on IT</a> in July 2021, for which I won the "Best Presentation" award. The paper describing my research can be found <a href="http://essay.utwente.nl/87066/">here</a>.</p>
